This file describes this project's coding conventions. There are many items to add here, but we will start
small and will improve over time.

1. Do not directly commit to dev or main/master. Do a PR with at least one reviewer;

2. Every code should be covered by at least one test, except for justifiable exceptions (e.g. argument parsing code);

3. Asserts should be used to check/avoid developer errors, while exceptions should be used for errors that might
appear due to incorrect usage of the tool by the user (e.g. a badly formed fasta file);

4. TODO: add lots more.
